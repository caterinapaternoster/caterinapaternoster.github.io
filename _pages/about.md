I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Social Statistics at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA), under the supervision of professor [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/). Here, I am currently involved in the ERC project “sociogeNEsis of criMinal nEtworks: reconStruction, dIscovery and diSruption” ([NEMESIS](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/nemesis.html#)).

I hold a Ph.D. in Criminology from Università Cattolica of Milan, where I also worked for more than three years as a researcher at Transcrime - the joint research centre on innovation and crime.


My main research interests include the application of network analysis to criminal networks, with a focus on the topics of mafias, organized crime, and financial crimes, alongside a broad interest in computational social science applications within the criminological field.
